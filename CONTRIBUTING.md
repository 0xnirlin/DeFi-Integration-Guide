## 📝 Documentation Guidelines

When adding or updating protocol documentation, please follow these guidelines:

1. Use the standardized format for describing functions, including:
   - Execution path
   - Execution steps
   - Revert conditions
   - Emitted events

2. 💡 Provide clear, concise explanations.

3. 🔗 Include links to relevant smart contract code when possible.

4. Each new protocol should be documented in a separate file. For example:
   - `AaveV3.md`
   - `DIVAProtocol.md`
   - `UniswapV3.md`

5. When adding a new protocol, refer to existing files (e.g., [`AaveV3.md`](./AaveV3.md)) as examples for the format and structure.

6. ✨ Ensure all code snippets are properly formatted and use syntax highlighting.

7. 💬 While we encourage using the established format for consistency, we're open to proposals for alternative formats if they can improve clarity or comprehensiveness. If you have ideas for a different approach, please open an issue to discuss it before submitting a pull request.

8. 🔄 If your team already follows a similar structure in your documentation, you can create a new file for your protocol and simply link to the existing documentation. Please include a brief summary and ensure the link is to a stable, maintained resource.
