# DeFi Integration Guide

## Overview

The modular nature of DeFi ecosystems offers tremendous value, but it also presents challenges. Inconsistent, incomplete, or missing documentation often makes it difficult for developers, auditors, and users to fully understand the integration points and behavior of key functions within these systems. This introduces unnecessary security risks and inefficiencies.

This repository aims to address these challenges by developing a standardized format for documenting core functions of DeFi protocols. Our approach focuses on clearly outlining:

* Execution steps
* Revert conditions
* Emitted events

By providing this structured information, we enable a deeper understanding of:

1. How contracts function
2. Potential edge cases that may lead to failures
3. Interactions between different parts of the system

Ultimately, this standardized documentation approach will contribute to improving the security and reliability of the overall DeFi ecosystem.
